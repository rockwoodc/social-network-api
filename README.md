## By Christian Rockwood

Social Network is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

To launch this application install a node server and use the command 'npm start' in your terminal. Then use Insomnia to test the routes and view the data.
